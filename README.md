# SBL content files

**Description**: Content supporting CFPB's information about the Small Business Lending rule.
This repo is a place for CFPB to host files to supplement the information published on consumerfinance.gov.

All versions of the Filing Instructions Guide (FIG) for the Small Business Lending Rule (SBL) can be accessed at this link:
http://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/small-business-lending/filing-instructions-guide/

## Finding SBL content files

If you are looking for the SBL FIG content, the easiest way to find it is to use the [Filing Instructions Guide archive page](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/small-business-lending/filing-instructions-guide/)
to find the version of the FIG you need, and follow the links on the page to the specific supplementary file you need.
For instance, the filing instructions for the 2024 filing year are located [here](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/small-business-lending/filing-instructions-guide/2024-guide/).
The FIG webpage contains links to the supplemental files contained in this repository.

However, you can also use this repository to find all published versions of these files.
If you want the latest version of the file specification and validation specification for the SBL data collection,
use the file navigator in this repo to visit [`/fig-files/file-spec/`](/fig-files/file-spec), where you can see the latest file content
and diff between versions of the files.

You can also use this repository to find previously published, outdated versions of these files.
To do so, browse the [releases](https://github.com/cfpb/sbl-content/releases) in this repository.
The releases use tags that include the filing year and version number, such as `2024-v1`.
